# Bucket List App

This is a React Bucket List app featuring JWT authentication. Features include login, logout, remember me, and reset password.

The back end currently lives at https://github.com/sdotson/bucket-list-server.

If you see something that could be improved, let me know!

The app is now live: http://stuartdotson.com/bucket-list/

## Setup

2. `npm start`
3. Go to `localhost:8080` in your browser.

## TO DO
